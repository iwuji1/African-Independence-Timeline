Hello!!! At the moment this is more for me to make sure I know how to respin this for just in case :D

This was ran on node and something I forgot :D
The main thing though is that to spin up the server you use the command "node index.js", it spits it out to local host 5000, naviagete there and you are gucci

The version of d3 here is v4, and GSAP was used to do most of the animations

the master in this project is called main, so when running git pull or push you are pushing to main not master

We'll leave it there for now but hopefully that helps future me!!
